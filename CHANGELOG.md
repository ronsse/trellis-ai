# Changelog

All notable changes to Trellis will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Classification Layer**: Hybrid deterministic + LLM tagging pipeline for all ingested content
  - Four orthogonal tag facets: `domain`, `content_type`, `scope`, `signal_quality`
  - Four deterministic classifiers: `StructuralClassifier`, `KeywordDomainClassifier`, `SourceSystemClassifier`, `GraphNeighborClassifier`
  - `LLMFacetClassifier` for async enrichment of ambiguous items (fires only when confidence < threshold)
  - `ClassifierPipeline` with two modes: ingestion (deterministic-only, microseconds) and enrichment (+ LLM fallback)
  - `compute_importance()` combining tags with LLM base scores for relevance ranking
  - `apply_noise_tags()` feedback loop: effectiveness analysis flags low-value items as noise, excluding them from future packs
  - Tag-based pre-filtering in `PackBuilder` (noise items excluded by default)

- **Web UI Foundation**: Dashboard served at `/ui` when running `trellis admin serve`
  - Live store stats (traces, documents, nodes, edges, events)
  - Store health status
  - Placeholder views for Graph Explorer, Evolution, Traces, and Precedents
  - Static files bundled in the PyPI wheel — no separate install needed

- **UI Design Documents**: Comprehensive design for full interactive UI
  - Graph Explorer with force-directed layout and time-travel slider
  - Evolution View: learning curve chart, pack composition drift, item lifecycle, domain generations
  - Trace Timeline, Improvement Dashboard, Precedent Library
  - ASCII wireframes, data flow diagrams, backend schema proposals
  - Demo scenario specification (8-week improvement arc from 40% to 85% success rate)

- **Package extras**: `all` convenience extra (`pip install trellis-ai[all]`)

### Changed

- FastAPI app version bumped to 0.2.0
- Fallback version updated to 0.2.0

### Fixed

- 22 code review issues across correctness, efficiency, and quality
  - `json_each` JOIN for multi-label domain filtering in SQLite stores
  - `get_node_history` ordering (DESC by `valid_from` for newest-first)
  - `StoreRegistry.close()` safety for partially initialized registries
  - `_emit_telemetry` exception handling in PackBuilder
  - Bounded idempotency cache (10K max) in MutationExecutor
  - `Content-Type` validation in API ingest routes
  - Defensive keyword extraction in `KeywordDomainClassifier`
  - `classification_version` default set to `"1"` in ContentTags

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- Initial release
- Core library (`trellis`): schemas, stores, mutation executor, retrieval, MCP server
