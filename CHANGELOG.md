# Changelog

All notable changes to Trellis will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Breaking changes

- **Removed `trellis-mcp-legacy` entry point** and deleted `src/trellis/mcp_server.py`. The current MCP server lives at `src/trellis/mcp/server.py` and is exposed as `trellis-mcp`. Anyone invoking `trellis-mcp-legacy` should switch to `trellis-mcp`.
- **Removed `[langgraph]` optional extra.** The LangGraph integration is no longer shipped in the wheel — it lives in [`examples/integrations/langgraph/`](examples/integrations/langgraph/) as a copy-paste reference template. Install `langgraph` and `langchain-core` directly in your project and copy `tools.py` in.
- **Moved `integrations/` to `examples/integrations/`.** None of the integrations (LangGraph, Obsidian, OpenClaw) ship in the wheel. They are reference templates you copy into your project. Test imports updated from `integrations.obsidian.*` to `examples.integrations.obsidian.*`.

### Added

- **PyPI publishing pipeline**: trusted-publisher (OIDC) workflow, `make build`/`verify-wheel`/`publish-check` targets, `workflow_dispatch` re-run path, `twine check` step, [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) runbook.
- **Examples directory** ([`examples/`](examples/)): SDK local + remote demos, retrieve→act→record loop, custom extractor, custom classifier, LangGraph agent, batch ingest script, and an MCP-from-Claude-Code walkthrough.
- **Skill templates** ([`skills/`](skills/)): drop-in Claude Code skills for `retrieve-before-task`, `record-after-task`, `link-evidence`.
- **MCP setup guides** for Claude Code, Cursor, and Claude Desktop in [`docs/getting-started/`](docs/getting-started/).
- **GitHub repo hygiene**: issue templates (bug, feature, config), PR template.
- **Python 3.13 support** added to CI matrix and PyPI classifiers.
- **`py.typed` markers** for `trellis_cli`, `trellis_sdk`, `trellis_api`, `trellis_workers` so type checkers see them as typed (`trellis` already had one).

### Changed

- **MCP server documentation now lists 11 tools, not 8.** The three sectioned-context tools (`get_objective_context`, `get_task_context`, `get_sectioned_context`) were already in the server but missing from every doc surface. Updated [docs/agent-guide/operations.md](docs/agent-guide/operations.md), [examples/integrations/openclaw/SKILL.md](examples/integrations/openclaw/SKILL.md), [README.md](README.md), and the IDE setup guides.
- **README links rewritten to absolute URLs** so they render correctly on PyPI.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Classification Layer**: Hybrid deterministic + LLM tagging pipeline for all ingested content
  - Four orthogonal tag facets: `domain`, `content_type`, `scope`, `signal_quality`
  - Four deterministic classifiers: `StructuralClassifier`, `KeywordDomainClassifier`, `SourceSystemClassifier`, `GraphNeighborClassifier`
  - `LLMFacetClassifier` for async enrichment of ambiguous items (fires only when confidence < threshold)
  - `ClassifierPipeline` with two modes: ingestion (deterministic-only, microseconds) and enrichment (+ LLM fallback)
  - `compute_importance()` combining tags with LLM base scores for relevance ranking
  - `apply_noise_tags()` feedback loop: effectiveness analysis flags low-value items as noise, excluding them from future packs
  - Tag-based pre-filtering in `PackBuilder` (noise items excluded by default)

- **Web UI Foundation**: Dashboard served at `/ui` when running `trellis admin serve`
  - Live store stats (traces, documents, nodes, edges, events)
  - Store health status
  - Placeholder views for Graph Explorer, Evolution, Traces, and Precedents
  - Static files bundled in the PyPI wheel — no separate install needed

- **UI Design Documents**: Comprehensive design for full interactive UI
  - Graph Explorer with force-directed layout and time-travel slider
  - Evolution View: learning curve chart, pack composition drift, item lifecycle, domain generations
  - Trace Timeline, Improvement Dashboard, Precedent Library
  - ASCII wireframes, data flow diagrams, backend schema proposals
  - Demo scenario specification (8-week improvement arc from 40% to 85% success rate)

- **Package extras**: `all` convenience extra (`pip install trellis-ai[all]`)

### Changed

- FastAPI app version bumped to 0.2.0
- Fallback version updated to 0.2.0

### Fixed

- 22 code review issues across correctness, efficiency, and quality
  - `json_each` JOIN for multi-label domain filtering in SQLite stores
  - `get_node_history` ordering (DESC by `valid_from` for newest-first)
  - `StoreRegistry.close()` safety for partially initialized registries
  - `_emit_telemetry` exception handling in PackBuilder
  - Bounded idempotency cache (10K max) in MutationExecutor
  - `Content-Type` validation in API ingest routes
  - Defensive keyword extraction in `KeywordDomainClassifier`
  - `classification_version` default set to `"1"` in ContentTags
