"""What a feedback caller can legitimately cite for a given pack.

Attribution is the join key of the learning loop: ``learning.pack_observations``
matches ``FEEDBACK_RECORDED`` against ``PACK_ASSEMBLED`` on ``pack_id``, then
grades the pack's items by the ``helpful_item_ids`` / ``unhelpful_item_ids``
the caller supplied. Feedback that names no items contributes zero per-item
rows, so it is invisible to the promote half of the loop.

This module answers one narrow question — *which item ids did this pack
actually serve?* — from the authoritative record, the pack's own
``PACK_ASSEMBLED`` event. It exists so an agent-facing surface can hand a
caller the real ids instead of the caller reconstructing them from the
rendered markdown it may no longer hold in context.

**It never invents attribution.** The served list is what the pack contained,
not what the agent found useful; the two are different claims and only the
caller can make the second. Nothing here writes to the feedback payload — the
one guarantee is that a caller who wants to cite is not blocked by having lost
the ids. That distinction is the same one
:meth:`trellis.feedback.models.PackFeedback.from_agent_signal` draws when it
deliberately leaves ``items_served`` empty rather than unioning the cited ids.
